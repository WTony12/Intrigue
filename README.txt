WELCOME TO INTRIGUE: (BETA)

This is an application that uses a self created symmetric key algorithm to encrypt and decrypt text files. Developed in August 2015.

Author: Tony Wagdi


RUNNING INTRIGUE:

1) Run Terminal

2) Move to this directory (~/Intrigue)

3) run this command: ./Intrigue


USER INTERFACE:

There are three options you may pick:

1) File Encryption

You will be asked to input the path of the file you would like to encrypt. It must be in the (.txt) format. You will then be asked to input the output directory. This will output two files, one containing the encrypted file (Encrypted.txt), and the other containing the keys needed to decrypt it (Keys.txt).

2) File Decryption

You will first be asked to input the path of the encrypted file. Then you will be asked for the path of the file containing the keys needed for decryption. Finally you will be asked to input the output directory that will contain the Decrypted file (Decrypted.txt).


3) Exit Intrigue

Exit the program.


NOTE:

Since this is a symmetric key encryption, it is imperative that the senders and receivers keep the Keys.txt file secret and not send it across unsecure networks. It is also recommended to change the file's name to something obscure.
